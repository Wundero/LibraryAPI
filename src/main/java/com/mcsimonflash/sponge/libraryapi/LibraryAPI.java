    /*
     * LibraryAPI is Sponge utility plugin that implements common functions used
     * throughout Sponge plugins.
     *
     * The goal of this project is to:
     *
     * 1. Simplify difficult and complex actions to make it easier for
     * developers (especially those new to Sponge) to use advanced features.
     *
     * 2. Provide a logical, complete, and fast implementation of features that
     * is tested and well documented.
     *
     * 3. Serve as a single location for common actions to minimize reuse of the
     * same code throughout plugins (which often leads to mistakes).
     *
     * Remember, any discussion about this plugin must be whispering.
